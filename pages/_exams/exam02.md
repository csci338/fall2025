For the midterm exam, you can bring a **one-page cheatsheet** (front-and back) with notes. That said:

1. Your cheatsheet **may not include any pre-worked Python or Java problems**. I will provide you with a <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1aMex1ismeO4HS9AYHVjbf-KIu6dWkqCjvFVqK_ICkAU/edit?usp=sharing" target="_blank" style="text-decoration: underline;">Python cheatsheet</a> with some common syntax rules.
1. You **may** include bash / git commands.
1. You **may** include notes on the readings and big ideas.

At the beginning of class on Tuesday, after I review your cheatsheet, you may begin your exam.
